Hello, I'm Sam and welcome to my personal site. I'm a software engineer with a focus on DevOps tools and practices. I'm also a futurist, so predictably I'm a blockchain and crypto enthusiast. This website is designed to capture some off-the-cuff thoughts and also to informally document notes or steps I've taken in a task I've done.

#### Newsletter
I write a weekly newsletter focussing mainly on philosophical topics, however it's a process of refinement so I suspect it could change as the weeks go on. If you fancy following that refinement journey you can sign up [here](https://newsletter.samclusker.com). 

#### In Futurae Fidelis
I also write more informative/speculative pieces over on [In Futurae Fidelis](https://futuraefidelis.co.uk) with a friend of mine [Harry Moy](https://twitter.com/HarryMoy). The latin translation is roughly 'faithful in the future' because we're both super excited about the future and the changes it brings! We write about upcoming technologies and sometimes get a little whacky discussing the future of society and the impact technology will have on it. Have a gander!

#### Future Talk
As well as writing about the future, Harry and myself also talk about it. The 'Future Talk' podcast is a great way for us to bounce ideas of one another and also get thinking more creatively about what the future might hold. You can listen on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/future-talk/id1560622460?uo=4), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/43iRuy0lhll1MCe6I7jRNh), [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy80ZGQ0ODE3MC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==) and [more](https://anchor.fm/future-talk). Perhaps you'd like to come on the show and have your say on the topic of that week! Get in touch.
